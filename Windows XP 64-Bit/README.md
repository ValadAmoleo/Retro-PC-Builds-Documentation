# Windows XP 64-Bit Retro Gaming Build

This machine is part of my personal retro PC project, tailored for running Windows XP 64-Bit-era titles at native performance on real hardware. It‚Äôs built with performance and compatibility in mind for mid 2000s gaming.

## History

## Reasoning

- The 9800 GX2 is a single card SLI and as I'd already bought a single card SLI for my Windows 7 build I wanted to try it out.
- Currently I'm using a 9800 GT for PhysX.  This is purely because I had one lying around.  I'm looking to buy an Ageia PhysX card to use instead.

## Ideal Games for This Build

- Doom 3 (EAX4)
- FEAR (EAX5)
- Half-Life 2 (EAX4)
- Far Cry (EMBM, AMD64)
- Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (PPU PhysX)

## Issues Encountered

- I had to remove the plastic section at the back of the PCI-e x1 port to allow a physical x16 length 9800 GT.  Obviously this will still only run at reduced bandwidth but it makes it mechanically compatible.  It was only after this I realised there were caps in the way on the board so had to buy a PCI-e x1 to x16 adapter anyway!  D'oh!
- The 9800 GX2 was overheating severly.  So it has been removed to be re-pasted.
- Steam, obviously, does not work on Windows XP anymore and there are no work arounds.  Hoping to buy a ZuluIDE soon so that I don't have to keep a physical CD drive attached.
