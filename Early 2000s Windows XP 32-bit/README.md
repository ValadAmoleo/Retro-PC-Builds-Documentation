# Windows XP 64-Bit Retro Gaming Build

This machine is part of my personal retro PC project, tailored for running Windows XP 32-Bit-era titles at native performance on real hardware. It’s built with performance and compatibility in mind for early 2000s gaming.

## History

## Mission Statement

To create a PC that runs games that have mid era EAX, lack 64-bit support or make use of Table Fog, Paletted Textures or EMBM at a target resolution of 1024x768.

## Reasoning

- The Geforce 4 Ti 4600 was the last generation of NVIDIA cards to support Table Fog and Paletted Textures natively.

---

## Ideal Games for This Build

- Max Payne (EAX3)
- Unreal Tournament (EMBM)



---

## Issues Encountered

- Steam, obviously, does not work on Windows XP anymore and there are no work arounds.  Hoping to buy a ZuluIDE soon so that I don't have to keep a physical CD drive attached.

## Setup Tips

- Explain using Legacy Update
